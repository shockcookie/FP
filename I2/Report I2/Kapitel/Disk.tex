\section{Discussion of the Results}
\subsection{Absorption Spectrum}
In the first part of the experiment we measured the absorption spectrum of iodine. First of all the constants $\omega_e$ and $\omega_ex_x$ had to be calculated by using a Birge-Sponer-Plot. The values are compared in table \ref{1} with the literature values. The values are compared with equation \ref{vgl}
\begin{equation}
	t=\frac{x_{\text{Measure}}-y_\text{Literature}}{\sigma_x}
\end{equation}
